# Examples of my work

## **Overview**
This repository was created in order to demonstrate the examples of code, which was written by me while I took part in different courses. It may be beneficial for employers, who can look through some examples of my work to get general understanding of my knowledge.

### **Navigation:**
1. [Python](https://github.com/ekaterina1457/Examples-of-my-work/tree/main/Python). Here you can find the solutions to some tasks, which I solved while attending the course [Программирование на Python](https://stepik.org/course/67/info) and its second part [Python: основы и применение](https://stepik.org/course/512/info).
2. [R-language](https://github.com/ekaterina1457/Examples-of-my-work/tree/main/R_language/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20R), where you can see the solutions to some basic tasks, which can be performed with R for data analysis. These tasks were taken from the course [Основы программирования на R](https://stepik.org/course/497/info).
3. The repo [Certificates](https://github.com/ekaterina1457/Examples-of-my-work/tree/main/Certificates) provides you with brief information concerning the couses which I have already taken, the scores which I succeeded to gain and dates, when these couses were finished.
